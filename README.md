# Game development with Macroquad

This is a guide, created by Olle Wreede for creating a game in Rust Macroquad,
that I have been following. This code is modified, I found their guide a little
hard to follow given that all of their code was in the same file. I am sharing
what I have done to make the code a little easier to read, while I continue to
follow the tutorial, and modify other parts. I am using their tutorial to gain
a better grasp on the rust coding language, and improve my ability to create
programming projects.
